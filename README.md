# DSA & SQL Problem Solving Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and SQL problem-solving repository! This is a collection of my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and other competitive programming sites.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and SQL through consistent practice and problem-solving. Each problem is approached with multiple solution strategies, allowing me to:

- **Explore different approaches** to the same problem
- **Compare time and space complexities** of various solutions
- **Identify the most optimal solution** for each problem
- **Practice in multiple programming languages** to strengthen my understanding
- **Solve SQL queries** using different techniques and optimizations

## 🎯 My Approach

### Problem-Solving Methodology

1. **Multiple Solutions**: For each problem, I attempt to solve it using different approaches:
   - Brute force solutions (for understanding)
   - Optimized solutions (for efficiency)
   - Alternative algorithms (for learning)

2. **Complexity Analysis**: I analyze and document:
   - Time complexity (Big O notation)
   - Space complexity
   - Trade-offs between different approaches

3. **Best Solution Selection**: After implementing multiple solutions, I:
   - Compare their performance
   - Explain why one approach is better than others
   - Document the reasoning behind the optimal solution

### Multi-Language Practice

I solve problems in multiple programming languages to:
- Understand language-specific optimizations
- Learn different paradigms and approaches
- Build versatility in problem-solving

**Primary Languages:**
- **C++** - For competitive programming and performance-critical solutions
- **Python** - For rapid prototyping and readability
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - For web development context and modern JS features
- **SQL** - For database queries, optimization, and data manipulation problems
